# Colby Trails Map App

This SwiftUI app displays interactive trail maps of the Perkins Arboretum surrounding Colby College, allowing users to view trails, their information, and their current location on the map. 

## Features

- 📍 User location tracking  
- 🗺️ Interactive map view with trail overlays 
- 🧾 Trail information cards (needs work)
- 🧭 Alternate map view options (satellite, terrain)

This app is *very much* a work in progress, and I have not had time to continue work on it.
